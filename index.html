          <p>"Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave/I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place/Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved/And they don't like that, it's written all on they face/I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean/Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team/Iconic duos rip and split at the seams/Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes"</p>

          <p>"Look at the way we live/I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world, I was hidin' the world from my kid/From empty souls who just wake up and looked to debate/Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate/Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs/The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call/They always ask, 'Why let the story run if it's false?'/You know a wise man once said nothin' at all"</p>

          <p>"She said, 'Do you love me?' I tell her, 'Only partly'/I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry/50 dub, I even got it tatted on me/81, they'll bring the crashers to the party/And you know me/Turn the O2 into the O3, dog/Without 40, Oli, thereâ€™d be no me/Imagine if I never met the broskies"</p>
